					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>
						I am a third year software engineering student at the University of Victoria.
						Before attending UVic, I took four semesters at the University of The Fraser Valley.
						While at the University of The Fraser Valley I played on the men's volleyball team.
					</p>

						My site has multiple different sections. Education contains a summary of my current 
						and completed courses. Skills has a list of different soft and technical skills I have
						learned while attending UVic. Projects has a link to my GitHub and a description of the

									ECE 255 introduced me to the various components present in a computer. 
									Memory, input and output devices, instruction cycles, assembly language, buses, and processors were covered in the course. 
									I'm familiar with various memory types such as ROM, RAM ,Hard Disk Drives, cache and processor registers. 
									We covered the basics about memory structure and functionality. We covered interrupts and polling with input and output devices. 
									The instruction cycle covered in the course was: fetch, decode, execute, store, and increment the program counter. 
									I know how to build subroutines. We were introduced to the system bus; the system bus allows communication between components. 
									Register usage and the binary versions of instructions were covered. Word length and the advantages and disadvantages of having longer words was taught as well.

									I've completed one 100 level course for linear algebra and two 100 level courses for calculus. 
									I have completed a 200 level course for time signals and systems. 
									Solving matrices, matrix arithmetic, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transformation matrices, complex numbers, and working with spaces of various dimension described by real or complex valued unit vectors are all concepts I've learned from linear algebra. 
									Tools I've learned in calculus are derivation, integration and various techniques for performing the operations. 
									In time signals and systems, I gained the tools to convert a signal into a Fourier series and apply the Fourier transform and Laplace transform. 
									The course introduced to the basics of sampling and interpolation, amplitude modulation, and modelling systems using differential equations.

									I am familiar with Java, C++, C, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with ARM Assembly language.
									Specifically, I've programmed the STM32 Cortex™-M0 processor in my Computer Architecture course: ECE 255. 
									The languages I'm most familiar with are Java and C++; both languages were introduced to me in university. 
									I've built multiple abstract data types using Java such as stacks, heaps, and binary search trees. 
									I am confident I could build the same structures in C++. I've programmed a little in C, but I've never taken a class focused on the language. 
									I learned both HTML and CSS in high-school. Aside from this website, I've never built any major projects using HTML and CSS.

									Communication is one of my best skills. Whether talking in person, through email or on the phone, I communicate effectively. 
									I've completed multiple group projects while studying. I have worked in a group to design and present a solution to a problem on two occasions. 
									The first occasion was at UFV. My group and I needed to design a device to collect algae; the algae was to be used as a food source in a remote village. 
									We communicated regularly and delivered the presentation on time. 
									The second group project I was a member of was at UVIC. 
									My group and I needed to develop a method of reducing single occupancy vehicles in the CRD (Capital Region District) on Vancouver Island.
									We used slack to coordinate our group meetings. Often, I was the one initiating discussion about due dates and assignment criteria. 
									The course instructor had his students complete smaller preliminary assignments to ensure his students didn't fall behind. 
									My group and I never missed a due date while building our solution

									I'm a confident speaker. I've given multiple presentations throughout university. 
									Being a part of the volleyball team also helped me become a better speaker. 
									Volleyball gave me plenty of practice being in front of large crowds. 
									I have given a total of three oral presentations in my engineering courses. 
									My English courses required me to give one group presentation; two speeches presented by myself were also required.

									I owe my teamwork abilities to the numerous sports teams I've been a part of. 
									I played, throughout high-school, both volleyball and basketball. Most recently, I played on The University of The Fraser Valley men's volleyball team. 
									Emotions can run rampant during a match or even practice; conflict between teammates in stressful situations is extremely common. 
									However, experiencing tense situations between teammates has allowed me to build excellent teamwork skills. 
									I am able to compromise, maintain constructive discussions, and act professionally. My teamwork skills have earned me multiple jobs. 
									I have worked at Costco Wholesale Langley and the City of Surrey South Operations Yard. 
									Both jobs require you to work effectively with your co-workers in order to complete tasks

				<h3>
					Camping and Hiking
				</h3>
				<p>
					Camping and hiking are my favourite pastimes. I love being outdoors. Studying software engineering, I spend a lot of time inside and in front of a screen. 
					I love what I am studying, but it would be unhealthy if I didn't take breaks.
					My favourite hike so far has been the chief. The view is spectacular from the first peak. I'm planning on going back to hike the second and third peaks. 
					The picture below is of my girlfriend and I at the lower falls in Golden Ears. 
					We spent the weekend camping at Gold Creek.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Basketball
				</h3>
				<p>
					Although I played volleyball at a post-secondary level. Basketball is by far my favourite sport to both watch and play. 
					I didn't pursue basketball because I knew I had a far better chance of playing volleyball at a higher level. 
					Despite how much I enjoy the game, I am not very good. 
					I loved playing in high-school and now I occasionally get together with a couple friends and play. 
					I don't watch much of the regular NBA season, but I love watching the playoffs
				</p>
				<h3>
					Travel
				</h3>
				<p>
					My high-school hosted a grade 9 trip to Europe. I got to tour through Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. 
					Italy was my favourite. While in Italy I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, walk inside the dome of the Duomo in Florence, and hike along the Cinqua Terre in Liguria. 
					In France we got to go up the Eiffel Tower. My favourite part of the trip was the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain. 
					I've also been to Edmonton and Calgary for various volleyball tournaments.	
				</p>
				<h3>
					Reading
				</h3>
				<p>
					I really enjoy reading. I've read: The Hunger Games series, The Hobbit, and The Shining alongside some other less known novels. 
					My favourite author, hands down, is Stephen King. He does an incredible job of creating suspense.
					My favourite story of his would have to be Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption. 
					The movie The Shawshank Redemption is based on that story.
