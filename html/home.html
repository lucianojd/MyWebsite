					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>
						I am a third year software engineering student at the University of Victoria.
						My graduation year will be 2022. Before attending UVic, I took four semesters 
						at the University of The Fraser Valley.
					</p>
					<p>
						My primary focus in school is web technologies. I am interested in developing websites
						and web applications. My most prominent projects so far are my website and a <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com">Battlesnake</a>.
						Windows and Linux are the two development environments I am most
						familiar with, but I have also used macOS in a professional setting for quality assurance.
					</p>
					<h3>About The Website</h3>
					<p>
						My website makes use of HTML, CSS, and JQuery. I wrote my scripts using Typescript. 
						My site is hosted using GitHub's free hosting service GitHub pages and my domain was
						purchased at Namecheap.
