            <P>
                Currently, I am studying at the University of Victoria.
                I am in the third year of the software engineering program.
                In 2018 I transferred from the University of the Fraser Valley.
            </P>
            <p>
                At the University of the Fraser Valley, I spent two years in the engineering transfer program.
                I played on the men's volleyball team while at UFV.
