Communication
Communication is one of my strongest skills. Whether it's instant messaging, video calls, or technical writing I 
am able to communicate in a concise manner. One example was coordinating a group project to build a robot using
a VEX robotics kit. I wrote the software and communicated through Facebook messenger with my group members to coordinate 
meetings, discussing ideas, and requirements for each members tasks.

Public Speaking
I'm a confident speaker. I've given multiple presentations throughout university. 
My biggest audience was an auditorium of about one hundred of my peers. We were all in a computer human interaction course.
I gave a two and a half minute presentation describing an interface I designed with my group.

Teamwork
I gained a lot of teamwork experience while playing basketball and volleyball through highschool and continuing with volleyball
into university. I also worked in various group projects through university. My two most notable group projects were building
a robot using a VEX robotics kit and designing an application interface.
