		Programming Languages
	</h2>
		<p>
		I am familiar with Java, C++, C, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with ARM Assembly
		language. Specifically, I've programmed the STM32 Cortexâ„¢-M0 processor in my Computer Architecture
		course: ECE 255. The languages I'm most familiar with are Java and C++; both languages were introduced
		to me in university. I've built multiple abstract data types using Java and I am confident I could build
		the same structures in C++. I've programmed a little in C, but I've never taken a class focused on the language.
		I learned both HTML and CSS in highschool. Aside from this website, I've never built any major projects
		using HTML and CSS.
