	Camping and Hiking
	</h2>
		<p>
		Camping and hiking are my favorite pastimes. I love being outdoors. Studying
		software engineering, I spend a lot of time inside and in front of a screen. I love
		what I am studying, but it would be unhealthy if I didn't take breaks. My favorite hike
		so far has been the chief. The view is spectacular from the first peak. I'm planning on 
		going back to hike the second and third peaks.

	<h2>
	Basketball
	</h2>
		<p>
		Although I played volleyball at a post-secondary level. Basketball is 
		by far my favorite sport to both watch and play. I didn't pursue basketball
		because I knew I had a far better chance of playing volleyball at a higher
		level. Despite how much I enjoy the game, I am not very good. I loved playing
		in highschool and now I occasionally get together with a couple friends and play.
		I don't watch much of the regular NBA season, but I love watching the playoffs.
