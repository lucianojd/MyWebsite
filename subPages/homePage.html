<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently studying at the University of Victoria. I am in the Bachelors of Software Engineering program. I started at The
University of The Fraser Valley. I studied engineering there for two years. While studying, I played on the men's volleyball team.</p>

<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>This website was made with the help of GitHub pages and namecheap. The student packaged offered by GitHub allowed me to get
a free domain name with namecheap and host my website using GitHub pages. A huge thanks to GitHub and namecheap for offering 
this service to students.</p>
